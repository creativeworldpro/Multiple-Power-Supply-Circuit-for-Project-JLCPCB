In this project, we’ll teach you making a multiple power supply circuit. It is a very cheap and useful SMT project circuit. To make different type project, sometimes we need different type voltage. As like 3.3v, 5v, 9v and 12v. For this case, we need to use different, different power supply.

But using this small and cheap SMT circuit, you don’t need to use different power supply circuit.

To make this circuit, we use bridge power supply circuit formula, liner voltage regulator and a 12v (3 amp) transformer.

Component List - 

To making this SMT multiple power supply circuit, we are using some SMD components.  You can order your assembled SMT circuit form JLCPCB.

All components list have been given below –

•	Transformer – 12v

•	Diode – 1N 4007 *4

•	Resistor – 1 KΩ

•	LED

•	Capacitor - 1000µf / 25v

•	Liner Voltage Regulator – 7812, 7809, 7805, 7803

•	Output Sockets

Liner Voltage Regulator Pin Out - 

Liner voltage regulator IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer. This 3 pin integrated IC 3 different pinout. 

Its 3 legs pinout can be seen above.

•	In

•	GND

•	Out

The specialty of this IC is that, this IC can output fixed voltage.
